## What is this project about? </br>
**Inception** was a project that taught me about Docker containers, Docker images, Docker compose and system administration in general. I had to set different services such as a WordPress website fully configured inside a docker container with its own database and hosted on a Nginx server.</br></br>

## Biggest Challenges ðŸ’ª

Some of the biggest challenges I faced were, knowing which files I should modify beforehand to later introduce them inside the containers, where to modify them and the creation of the different scripts that I needed so that everything was configured automatically.
